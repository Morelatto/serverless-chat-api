Business value visualization:
- **Without cache**: $2,000/day for 1M requests
- **With cache**: $290/day (85% reduction)
- Daily savings: $1,710

**Key Insight**: Caching provides massive cost savings at scale.

## Visual Conventions
- **Line thickness** represents traffic percentage (7px vs 1px)
- **Green** for optimal path, **orange** for degraded
- **Cost annotations** show business impact
